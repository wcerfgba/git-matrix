we can now read from a file and write to a file. algorithm looks like its working and the performance is there. need to add in the other algorithms (commit count, percentage change), and maybe add 'cooling'.

also, coloring the table. then maybe grouping files/emails.

then, tests.

need to look for those git pair programming plugins sam was on about.
